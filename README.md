## Intoduction 

Some miscellaneous Python projects that I created or workd on. Mainly tests on some fonctionalities or exemple that I can reuse for other works as tutorials.

### Installing Python

There are currently two versions of python currently in use, I would suggest going with the latest Python 3 (3.x.x) because it is the future but there's no wrong choice here and you can switch from one to the other easily.

The [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) distribution is the easiest way to get you started with python, it comes with built in package, IDE and a lot of great stuffs.

 - Download [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

You can also do it the classic way, by downloading pyhton directly from there website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and then start coding on a text editor. </br>
Python should have already been installed if you're using a linux distribution. You can always check which version is intalled:

	python --version



### Python on Windows

Assuming that you've installed python via Anaconda, or manually (setting the environment path as well).

Start a python prompt on the command prompt:

	python

Install dependencies via pip on a command prompt:

	python -m pip install package

Install dependencies through a proxy

	python -m pip install --proxy http://user:password@proxyserver:port package

- Replace Package by the *package* you want to install
- the `-m` means module
- user and password are the ones you use to connect to your session (most probably)
-  The proxyserver and port are in 
	-  Control Panel > Internet Options > Connections > Lan Settings button

Run a python script on a command prompt:

	python.exe script.py arg1
